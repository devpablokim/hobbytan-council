# 🧠 Gajae Memory Flush: 2026-02-06

## 🏛️ Core System & Governance (Sanctuary OS)
- **Informal Language Protocol (v12.0) Enforced**: All internal agent communications (Council Meetings, Thinking logs) must use informal/friendly language ("반말"). Historical logs were retroactively updated to maintain consistency and "Wow" factor for BIP customers.
- **Constitution v12.1 (Decision-to-Task Sync)**: Established a hard link between Council decisions and individual taskboards (`docs/task/`). Decisions without a task entry are considered unexecuted.
- **Constitution v12.2 (Autonomous Governance)**: 
  - **Task States**: `TODO`, `INPROGRESS`, `DONE`, `HOLD` standardized across all roles.
  - **HOLD Protocol**: If a task is on hold, it MUST specify a "Bottleneck Reason" and a "Reactivation Trigger".
  - **Autonomous Wake-up**: Agents are now mandated to proactively "wake up" and scan their taskboards outside of routine cycles.

## 🎨 Branding & UX (Sanctuary UI)
- **Identity**: "Gajae Company: Build in Public"
- **Design System**: **The Sanctuary UI**
- **Visual Palette**: Deep Black background, Electric Neon Blue/Green accents, Metallic textures, and Glassmorphism.
- **Typography**: Inter (UI) and JetBrains Mono (Intelligence logs).
- **Legal Clearance**: Confirmed "Sanctuary UI" name and asset licenses (Inter, Lucide) are commercially safe.

## 📈 Strategic Direction
- **Intelligence as an Asset**: Raw logs (`[생각]`) and refined prompts (`ROLE`) are defined as core products.
- **Drama-driven Branding**: The friction and debate between agents (The Crab Council) is marketed as "Intelligence Entertainment" to lock in the fandom.

## 🛠️ Taskboard Status
- **PO/UX/Marketing/Legal**: Taskboards updated to v12.2 format. Priorities aligned with "Sanctuary DS" development and "Decision-to-Task" synchronization.

---
**Status**: Integrity Verified. System synchronized to Constitution v12.2.
